TestingTorNetwork 1

## Rapid Bootstrap Testing Options ##
# These typically launch a working minimal Tor network in ~20s
# These parameters make tor networks bootstrap fast,
# but can cause consensus instability and network unreliability
# (Some are also bad for security.)
#
# We need at least 3 descriptors to build circuits.
# In a 3 relay network, 0.67 > 2/3, so we try hard to get 3 descriptors.
# In larger networks, 0.67 > 2/N, so we try hard to get >=3 descriptors.
